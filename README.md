### User-defined keyboard shortcuts for Linux users who are still more used to Windows...

#### ...and have absolutely no interest in changing

Ever start to code and attempt a shortcut you're used to, only to have it do something else?

Kinda pisses you off, doesn't it?

It can be seriously frustrating, but that's what happens routinely to people who are starting to use:

 - A new / different text editor / IDE

 - A new OS / platform

The second one is the most irritating to me, as although I'd *expect* a different text editor to behave a little differently (as much as I might *wish* they all behaved the same), using the *same* text editor on a different platform is an insult to injury.  Too many changes at once is a true kick in dexterity's face.

Here you are, learning your new platform, getting used to a new OS, searching for some familiarity in a cross-platform editor you're already familiar with, and what happens?  The keyboard shortcuts have moved all around on you!

Some of them are different, some just don't work, some might even do all sorts of *weird stuff* (to you) in the OS *outside* of the editor, which might *really* freak you out if you're expecting a result that's familiar.  

I'm here to say, I totes feel your pain. But I'm here to offer some help getting used to your new platform - by making it more like the old one! 

Crutch, you say? Sure! What's wrong with grasping for *any* semblance of familiarity one can through using the same editor?  And is it really too much to ask that it behave like the same editor on the last platform?  If I wanted new experiences I'd use Kate, FFS.

While I'd desperately like the Linux version of VS Code to act *exactly* identically to the one I'm used to in Windows, alas, it's just not an option, as the developers have decided to make them different for whatever reason - conflicts with common OS keyboard shortcuts, typical key combinations that were already familiar to other platform users that got here before me, etc. (as if *they* were what mattered ... harumph!). 

So I'm attempting to ease the burden and drown my sorrows of this somewhat (not really) uncomfortable transition as much as possible with this short (yet, growing) list of user-defined keyboard shortcuts that can be added to VS Code

Just clone, download, or ctrl-c `keybindings.json` and put it into your own copy of the same file in your Linux copy of VS Code, save the file (an important step often unmentioned), and instantly it should start behaving more like you're used to in Windows (technology really *is* quite amazing). 

Feel free to write me an issue with more keybindings to add, and I'll put them in ASAP. I'd love to hear from people who'd like this list to be longer.  Obviously, if it's not important enough to me that it didn't screw me up while trying to code on the first day, it didn't make it into the first commit, or I couldn't figure out how make it to work (I'm looking at **you**, `ctrl` instead of `alt` for mult-cursor select key!), so maybe it doesn't really matter after all. Hopefully this list will be enough for others, too, but if not, I'm open to suggestions.  The premise of the repo might not make it seem like it, but I actually *am* willing to try *some* new things. 

And don't feel bad for being a stiff, unyielding curmudgeon, we all get old some day (hopefully - it sure beats the alternative). Embrace your unwillingness to change, you've come this far without having to learn *too* many new things, so it couldn't *possibly* be *that* bad.  Everyone has to draw the line *somewhere.*

Aside from the rant, if you're using KDE and any of these shortcuts don't start working right away after saving the `keybindings.json` file, go to `System Settings` --> `Shortcuts` and check there to see if there are any conflicts (you can search by keys, usually entered in order from left to right, with a `+` sign as the separator.

Obviously you'll want to get rid of those *right away*, lest you have to change *any* of your present-day, deep-seated behaviors.  The last thing *anyone* wants is to be the slightest bit uncomfortable for even a moment in time. After all, we are only human.
